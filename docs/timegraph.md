//gun.get('@').time((data, key, time)=>{ // subscribe to all incoming posts

pass it back to JS Date function, although I think it defaults to local not UTC
so like
new Date(Date.UTC(time))

and then lookup the various APIs on Date
I use something something like toLocaleTimeString
it is in the example/chat code

but there are different APIs for different string parsing
